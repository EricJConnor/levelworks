# ⚠️ EMAIL SENDER VERIFICATION REQUIRED

Your Resend API key is configured, but you need to verify your domain before emails can be sent.

## Why This Is Needed

Resend requires domain verification to prevent spam and ensure email deliverability. This is a one-time setup.

## Quick Setup

### Domain Authentication (Recommended)
1. Go to: https://resend.com/domains
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., levelworks.org)
4. Follow DNS setup instructions
5. Once verified, you can send from ANY email @yourdomain.com

## Current Configuration
- Resend API key is already configured
- Domain verification required for production emails

## Testing After Verification
Once domain is verified, try sending an estimate again. Email should work.

## Free Trial Users
All features work for free trial users - no subscription required for sending estimates!
