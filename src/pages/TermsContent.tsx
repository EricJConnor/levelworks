      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Free Trial:</strong> New users receive a 30-day free trial. Users who sign up with a valid referral code receive a 60-day free trial. No payment is required during the trial period.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Subscription Fee:</strong> After the trial, subscriptions are billed monthly. We offer tiered pricing for early adopters: the first 1,000 subscribers pay $4.00/month for life, the next 4,000 subscribers pay $5.00/month for life, and all subsequent subscribers pay $6.00/month. Once you lock in your rate, it remains the same for the lifetime of your subscription.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled before the renewal date. You may cancel anytime through your account settings.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Payment Methods:</strong> We accept major credit cards via Stripe. You authorize us to charge your payment method on file.</p>
      
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-slate-900">5. Referral Program</h2>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Active subscribers may participate in our referral program. Each subscriber receives a unique referral code to share.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Referral Rewards:</strong> When a new user signs up using a valid referral code, both the referrer and the new subscriber receive one free month of service. The new subscriber's trial is extended from 30 to 60 days. The referrer's current subscription trial or billing period is extended by 30 days.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Limitations:</strong> Referral rewards are non-transferable and have no cash value. We reserve the right to modify or terminate the referral program at any time. Abuse of the referral program, including self-referrals or fraudulent referrals, may result in account termination.</p>
